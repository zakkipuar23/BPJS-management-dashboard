# BPJS Management Dashboard
### This was my team submission when we join BPJS visualthon (data visualization hackathon)
### Before creating the dashboard, I learned about balance scorecard of BPJS that was made by my father as their consultant. It's important so we could know how is their strategy map, what is their priority, etc
To see the dashboard and its explanation, please refer to pdf file with name "Proposal BPJS Visualthon - 3 Daiyamondo". As the result, we got 4th rank amoung around 400 participants
